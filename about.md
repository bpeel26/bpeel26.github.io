# About

Hello there! First of all, thank you for visiting my blog :)

I'm a Spanish young lady, currently studying Business Management, but the last couple of years got really interested in Data Science and started to learn how to program. Therefore I decided to start a blog recently, where I would like to share little by little my personal projects with the world! I'm excited. Hope you like it!
